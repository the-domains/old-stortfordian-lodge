The Old Stortfordian Lodge is a school Lodge connected with the[Old Stortfordians of Bishops Stortford College][0].  The Old Stortfordian Lodge not only has Freemasonry at heart but also its direct connections with the College. Apart from the various ceremonies performed during the year, which are fun and rewarding to do, the Lodge prides itself on its fellowship and friendship. Funds raised go towards hospices and to many other needy organisations, both Masonic and non-Masonic.

Once a Freemason, you are permitted to visit Lodges throughout the UK and all over the world. Freemasonry is international and has one aim, that is to promote friendship and goodwill amongst all people and to be happy.

To become a member of the OS Lodge you will need a proposer and someone to second you. This should not be a problem if you are really interested in becoming a member of this much respected organisation.

Freemasonry is not a secret society and does not cost a lot of money.  It is a Charity, but you can determine your own level of contribution. There is a Lodge subscription payable each year and you pay for dinner after each Regular Meeting -- the rest is up to you!

The OS Lodge normally meets on the second Saturdays in March, June, October and December.

The current Worshipful Master is W Bro Tom Whieldon, who was installed at the regular meeting on Saturday 14th March 2015, at which the Deputy Provincial Grand Master was present, together with his entourage.

OS, their brothers, fathers, sons, sons-in-law, Governors of the College, Masters and past Masters of the College and anyone who has a very direct association with the College can become a member. A link with the College is an essential element to membership of the Old Stortfordian Lodge.

For the past couple of years, several of the OS Lodge members have gathered with a large number of friends (both freemasons and non-freemasons) at[The Hotel Britannia Excelsior][1]on the shores of Lake Como, Italy. The Hotel is run by OS, Ross Whieldon, his wife Doriana, son, Tom and daughter-in-law Pia, also both OS. Ross was Master of the OS Lodge in 2011\. Anyone interested in the Lake Como gathering should contact us[here][2]for more information.
